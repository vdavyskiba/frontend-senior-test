<h3>About</h3>

<p>Typical AngularJS + RequireJS web app skeleton</p>
<p>I had used this approach in a list of projects, it is ready for a scaling</p>
<p>Of course in real projects there also should be existed StateNamesConstants, TemplateCache and some other stuff like scripts concatenation, uglification, tests</p>
<p>I'm not good in design so i didn't even tried to made one</p>
<p>You can find some other my test and education projects, my commits via my github page <a href="https://github.com/vdavyskiba">github.com/vdavyskiba</a> </p>
